                <ul>
                    <li>visualize multiple traces in different colors and aided by many different maps (cycling, hiking, satellite, <a href="https://www.strava.com/heatmap" target="_blank">Strava heatmap</a> overlay, etc)</li>
                    <li>edit traces by adding, inserting, moving or deleting points</li>

                    <li>reduce the number of points</li>
                    <li>automatically add elevation data to traces if missing</li>
                    <li>merge multiple traces, extending time, heart rate, cadence and temperature data where needed</li>

                </ul>
                <p>It is a one-person side project created after messing with GPX files for some time. If you like the tool and use it frequently, please consider <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=TCK9RME3XUV9N&source=url" target="_blank" onclick="gtag('event', 'about', {'event_category' : 'donate'});">donating</a> as to cover bills from API calls (map display, routing and elevation features) and encourage me to keep improving the website. Thank you for your support!</p>
                <p>The project source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/gpxstudio/gpxstudio.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a> where I also put future developments.

                <h1><a name="privacy"></a>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><b>gpx.studio</b> is an online GPX file editor which allows users to create, view and edit files.
                    We respect the privacy of our users and do not collect any personal information except anonymous information such as the number of page views and clicks on buttons to help us enhance your overall experience.</p>
                <p>The files created, visualized or edited on the website are only read once and never stored on a server.
                    We only access the data contained in the files and handle all computations from your local browser (it is a pure client-side application).</p>
                <p>The code of the website is open-source (see <a href="#about">About</a>), we have nothing to hide.</p>
                <h2>Google Drive</h2>
                <p>The website offers the possibility to log in with Google Drive to upload and save files in order to facilitate the storage, versioning and sharing of GPX files.
                    That service authenticates you directly with your Google account, and an authentication token identifying you as the file owner is stored in your local browser session profile.
                    This information is used to browse GPX files in your Google Drive and to open only those you choose to open.
                    Furthermore, it is used to automatically authenticate users visiting the website again but it is never stored on our side.</p>
                <p>We use standard Google Drive sharing functionality when you decide to share the file, and standard Google Drive authentication, authorization mechanisms for access control.
                    No other files than those you create with the tool or decide to open with it (either by opening from Google Drive or visiting its associated URL on the tool) will be accessed, and none will ever be stored.</p>
