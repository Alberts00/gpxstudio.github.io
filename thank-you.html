                <h1>Thank you for supporting gpx.studio! ❤️</h1>
                <p>A huge thank you for your contribution! It definitely encourages me to keep the project moving forward and it will be put to good use at the end of the month.</p>
                <p>Concretely, your donation contributes to paying monthly bills to <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">Mapbox</a>, which provide some of the beautiful maps on the website and more importantly, which handle all routing tasks of the app.<br>
                To be completely transparent, you can look at the applicable rates <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/" target="_blank">here</a> under <b>Maps - Static Tiles API</b> and <b>Navigation - Directions API</b>. The free tiers are quite generous but once we exceed the quotas, it becomes very costly!</p>
                <p>If you have any suggestions to improve the website, please let me know and I will try to implement them. The users of the tool have already helped shape it in a very nice direction!</p>
                <p>You can stay in touch and follow the evolution of the website on <a href="https://facebook.com/gpx.studio" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
                <p>Best regards and again, thank you!</p>
